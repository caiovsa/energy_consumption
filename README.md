## Time Series - Hourly energy consumption

> TThe project aimed to develop an accurate time-series prediction model for hourly energy consumption using a comprehensive dataset. By leveraging historical energy consumption patterns we can achieve some good predictions and get some good insights.(This project and the data was taken from this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption))

> In this project I used some Machine Learning techniques and explored the data a little, so that in the end I could find the best results, i am still working on this project, so i an trying to give some updates.
